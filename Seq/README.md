Reference nucleotide (\*.fna files) and their translated protein (\*.faa files) sequences of genes _nfsA_, _nfsB_, and _ribE_ are offered here. Insertion sequences (ISs) interrupting _nfsA_ or _nfsB_ are provided subdirectory `IS`. `*_mutations.tsv` offers lists of known chromosomal mutations associated with nitrofurantoin resistance in _E. coli_.
